 * mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 * For every delta with one or two bits set, and the deltas of all three
 * high bits or all three low bits, whether the original value of a,b,c
 * is almost all zero or is uniformly distributed.
 * If mix() is run forward or backward, at least 32 bits in a,b,c
 * have at least 1/4 probability of changing.
 * If mix() is run forward, every bit of c will change between 1/3 and
 * 2/3 of the time.  (Well, 22/100 and 78/100 for some 2-bit deltas.)
 * mix() takes 36 machine instructions, but only 18 cycles on a superscalar
 * machine (like a Pentium or a Sparc).  No faster mixer seems to work,
 * that's the result of my brute-force search.  There were about 2^^68
 * hashes to choose from.  I only tested about a billion of those.

 * hash() -- hash a variable-length key into a 32-bit value
 *   k       : the key (the unaligned variable-length array of bytes)
 *   len     : the length of the key, counting by bytes
 *   initval : can be any 4-byte value
 *
 * Returns a 32-bit value.  Every bit of the key affects every bit of
 * the return value.  Every 1-bit and 2-bit delta achieves avalanche.
 * About 6*len+35 instructions.
 *
 * The best hash table sizes are powers of 2.  There is no need to do
 * mod a prime (mod is sooo slow!).  If you need less than 32 bits,
 * use a bitmask.  For example, if you need only 10 bits, do
 * h = (h & hashmask(10));
 * In which case, the hash table should have hashsize(10) elements.
 *
 * If you are hashing n strings (__u8 **)k, do it like this:
 * for (i=0, h=0; i<n; ++i) h = hash( k[i], len[i], h);

 * See http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/evahash.html
 * Use for hash table lookup, or anything where one collision in 2^^32 is
 * acceptable.  Do NOT use for cryptographic purposes.
